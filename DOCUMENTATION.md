**Q: Do I need to complete KYC?**  
A: No KYC required for decentralized features. Future fiat on-ramps may require KYC for compliance.

### RWA Vaults

**Q: What backs the RWA tokens?**  
A: RWA tokens represent ownership of real-world assets held by regulated custodians. Each token is backed 1:1 by physical assets.

**Q: How is yield generated?**  
A: Yield comes from:

- Asset appreciation (e.g., gold price increases)
- Rental income (for real estate)
- Interest payments (for bonds)
- Lending interest (protocol loans)

**Q: Can I withdraw physical assets?**  
A: Not directly. RWA tokens represent fractional ownership. For physical redemption, contact our institutional partners (minimum amounts apply).

**Q: What happens if I get liquidated?**  
A: If your collateral value falls below liquidation threshold (typically 125%), your position is automatically closed. Collateral is sold to repay debt plus liquidation penalty (5%).

### Trading

**Q: What's the minimum order size?**  
A: Minimum order size varies by pair:

- APT pairs: 1 APT
- Stablecoin pairs: $10 USDC
  No maximum limit.

**Q: How fast do orders execute?**  
A: Market orders: < 2 seconds
Limit orders: When price is met
Aptos blockchain processes 160,000+ TPS.

**Q: Can I cancel an order?**  
A: Yes, any unfilled limit order can be cancelled at any time. Small gas fee applies for on-chain cancellation.

**Q: Is there an API for trading bots?**  
A: API is under development. Sign up for early access at our GitHub.

### Social Trading

**Q: How much can I earn as a strategy provider?**  
A: Strategy providers earn:

- 10-30% performance fee (you set rate)
- 0.1% of total AUM annually
- Bonus rewards for top performers

**Q: Can I lose money copy trading?**  
A: Yes. Copy trading involves risk. Past performance doesn't guarantee future results. Always set stop losses.

**Q: What if the trader I follow makes bad trades?**  
A: You can:

- Stop copying immediately

- Diversify across multiple traders
